# Lambda-InstantCombat-Module
A module for LambdaPlayers that ports over Attack On Sight from Lambda Team Module. You don't need to have Fighter, or have Combat chance set to 100.


### 3 New Convars
- lambdaplayers_combat_attackothers
  - If Lambda Players should immediately start attacking anything at their sight.
  
- lambdaplayers_combat_huntdownothers
  - If Lambda Players should hunt down other Lambdas. 'Attack On Sight' option needs to be enabled for it to work.

- lambdaplayers_combat_defendmyself
  - If the Lambda Player being attacked should go after the attacker.
