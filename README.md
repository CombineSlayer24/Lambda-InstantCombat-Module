# Lambda-InstantCombat-Module
A module for LambdaPlayers and ports over the "Attack On Sight" feature from the Lambda Team Module, and expands upon it. With this module, you don't need to have the personality set to "Fighter" or have Combat chance set to 100.

## New Convars
The following are the new Convars that come with this module:

1. `lambdaplayers_combat_attackothers`: This determines whether LambdaPlayers should immediately start attacking anything at their sight.

2. `lambdaplayers_combat_huntdownothers`: This determines whether LambdaPlayers should hunt down other Lambdas.

3. `lambdaplayers_combat_defendmyself`: This determines whether the LambdaPlayer being attacked should go after the attacker.

4. `lambdaplayers_combat_attackothersonmove`: This determines whether LambdaPlayers should immediately start attacking anything when moving. 

5. `lambdaplayers_combat_defendmyselfchance`: This is the chance for a LambdaPlayer to defend themselves.

Please note that in order for the "Attack Randomly When Moving" and "Search For Prey" options to function, you must have the "Attack On Sight" option enabled.
